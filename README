This is an application I'm building, or atleast trying to build, for a school project.

The goal =

- Have a menu with buttons to navigate to your timeline or new tweet section.
- Have a Timeline where you can view recent tweets and their detail. (Currently I can see my own timeline, goal = global)
- Post a new tweet to twitter.


Things to do:

Make a menu
Style it all
Get global timeline

Optional: Get a detail with the picture, now its just an alertbox with the full tweet...
