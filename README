Did I tweet that Already?  v0.9

******************************************************

This is a school project for the course: "Mobile Development" at Lessius Hogeschool Mechelen.

	- Made by: Jelle De Clerck / 3-IMD-B
	- Madjdc @ www.madjdc.be

******************************************************

Basic features:

	- Main screen with buttons to navigate
	- A list filled with things coming from a webservice (This case Twitter)
	- A way to get the full view of a selected item in the list
	- A way to post a new record to an online webservice (This case a new Tweet)
	
	- All this in a correct lay-out
	
******************************************************

Special thanks to:

	- Twitter for their api
	- Jpurcell for the development of the Birdhouse.js code wich helped me alot
	
******************************************************

Notes:

	- The timeline that gets pulled is at the moment my own, hardcoded in tweets.js
	- Din't get the get_tweets running from the birdhouse.js 
	- For some basic lay-out functions I had to rewrite some parts of the manifest.xml 
	  and tiapp.xml files
	  This can be found in the platform folder, otherwhise they get overwritten
	  each fresh build.
	- The url tag from the images is deprecated, but android can still use that.
	- There are backbuttons on each screen so the function of the hardware backbutton 
	  remains to close the application.
	- If you want to post a new tweet, you will have to authorize the app with 
	  your account. This will enable you to post new tweets. 
	  (on your own timeline, not the hard-coded one)
	- The callback function is set at my own website, so dont do to many calls 
	  or I will be forced to pull down the app due to too much traffic.

******************************************************

Free to use:

	- All code is free to use to others, but I would like it alot, if you take anything, that you mention my name: Madjdc (www.madjdc.be)
